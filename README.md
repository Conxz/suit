# Spatially Unbiased Infratentorial Template (SUIT) 

 The SUIT toolbox is a toolbox written in Matlab for the analysis of human cerebellar Magnetic Resonance Imaging data. It provides functionality to 

* Automatically isolate cerebellar structures from the cerebral cortex based on an anatomical image
* Accurate normalise individual cerebella into a group template
* Display the functional data on a surface-based [flatmap ](http://www.diedrichsenlab.org/imaging/suit_flatmap.htm)
* Provide a range of anatomical, connectivity, and functional Atlases for the human cerebellum in a common space 
* Improve normalization of the deep cerebellar nuclei using an [ROI-driven normalization](http://www.diedrichsenlab.org/imaging/suit_function.htm#suit_normalize_dentate).
