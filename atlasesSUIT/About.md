## Cerebellar Atlases 

The SUIT toolbox provides a collection of anatomical and functional atlases of the human cerebellum. The altases come either as Nift-volumes aligned to SUIT space, or as Gifts-files projected on the cerebellar flat map. The atlases can also be downloaded as a standalone from the website as Nift-volumes in MNI-spaces (FNIRT).

#### Probabilistic atlas of cerebellar lobules: Diedrichsen et al. (2009).
The anatomical definitions are based on the fMRI atlas of an individual cerebellum by Schmahmann et al. (2000). We manual identified the main lobules on MRI scans of 20 healthy young participants (ROIs 1-28). Using a different set of 23 participants, we also masked the deep cerebellar nuclei (ROIs 29-34)

#### Task free parcellation: Buckner et al. (2011) 
Buckner et al. presented the first functional  atlas of the human cerebellum, based on the correlation of each cerebellar voxel and with cortical resting state networks. A parcellation of 7 and 17 regions is available.

#### Multi-domain task battery: King et al. (2019)

The Multi-domain task battery contains the mean contrast maps for the 47 task conditions and three motor features. The MDTB atlas then contains functional parcellations into 7, 10, or 17 regions.
