## Functional example data sets in SUIT space
#### HCP task data: 

HCP*.nii contain the group activity maps for 186 subjects from the human connectome project (HCP) task data set, which have been individually masked and normalized into SUIT space (for details, see King et al., 2019).
The tasks and contrasts are described in detail in:

#### Multi-domain task battery: King et al. (2019)
The Multi-domain task battery (MDTB) contains the group-average contrast maps for the 47 task conditions and three motor features. For more details on tasks and methods see:

#### Cerebellar finger representation: Wiestler et al. (2011)
Wiestler_2011_motor_z.nii are the z-value of average classification for the movement of individual fingers, which can be used as a functional localiser for the two cerebellar finger representations. For details see:
