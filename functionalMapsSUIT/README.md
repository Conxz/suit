## Functional example data sets in SUIT space
#### HCP task data: 

HCP*.nii contain the group T-values for 100 subjects from the human connectome data set, which have been morphed slightly from the FSL space into SUIT space. 

The tasks and contrasts are described in detail in: 

Barch DM, Burgess GC, Harms MP, Petersen SE, Schlaggar BL, Corbetta M, Glasser MF, Curtiss S, Dixit S, Feldt C, Nolan D, Bryant E, Hartley T, Footer O, Bjork JM, Poldrack R, Smith S, Johansen-Berg H, Snyder AZ, Van Essen DC (2013) Function in the human connectome: task-fMRI and individual differences in behavior. *Neuroimage* 80:169-189.


#### Multi-domain task battery: King et al. (2019)
The Multi-domain task battery (MDTB) contains the group-average contrast maps for the 47 task conditions and three motor features. For more details on tasks and methods see:

King, M., Hernandez-Castillo, C.R., Poldrack, R.R., Ivry, R., and Diedrichsen, J. (2019). Functional Boundaries in the Human Cerebellum revealed by a Multi-Domain Task Battery. *Nature Neuroscience*.

#### Cerebellar finger representation: Wiestler et al. (2011)
Wiestler_2011_motor_z.nii are the z-value of average classification for the movement of individual fingers, which can be used as a functional localiser for the two cerebellar finger representations. For details see:  

Wiestler T, McGonigle DJ, Diedrichsen J (2011) Integration of sensory and motor representations of single fingers in the human cerebellum. *Journal of Neurophysiology* 105:3042-3053.
